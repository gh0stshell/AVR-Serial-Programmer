Basic Installation
==================

To use this, unpack into a directory which by default will be
serial-programmer-pc.

Make sure that QT5, qt4-designer, qmake-qt5 are installed and also under Ubuntu
install libqt5serialport5-dev and libudev-dev.

Return to the serial-programmer-pc directory. The default serial port used is
/dev/ttyUSB0 This can be changed in the command line. Execute:

$ make clean
$ qmake
$ make

This will build the application. Copy the binary to a suitable place and invoke
with:

$ avrserialprog

A range of command line parameters are available for GUI-less usage
(see the README).
