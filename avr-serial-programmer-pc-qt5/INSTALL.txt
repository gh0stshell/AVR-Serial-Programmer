Basic Installation
==================

To use this, unpack into a directory which by default will be serial-programmer-pc.
Obtain QextSerialPort v1.2beta1 or later from http://qextserialport.sourceforge.net/
and unpack the tarball into the directory qextserialport. This directory can be
changed in avrserialprog.pro. Make sure that you have QT4 installed. The project
file is set to compile qextserialport into the serial programmer binary.

Return to the serial-programmer-pc directory. The default serial port used is
/dev/ttyUSB0 This can be changed in the command line. Execute:

$ make clean
$ qmake
$ make

This will build the application. Copy the binary to a suitable place and invoke with:

$ avrserialprog

A range of command line parameters are available for GUI-less usage (see the README).
